I am learning something through examples, while I find one example might connect to multiple knowledges/topics/conclusions. 
I usually write down the example containing words and images and attachments and copy them to other docs representing other knowledge. 
While my knowledges updating, I have to modified those examples, merge, split...  Finally I am tired of maintaining them manually, I'll make something to "one for all".

Thus comes this small tool......
